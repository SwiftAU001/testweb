I am currently learning front end development and have made a VERY basic website with the stuff that I have learnt within 1 day.

This repository includes 3 files which are index.html, dashboard.html and login.html.

index.html contains 18 lines of very simple html code which is the head tag and that includes the 3 main meta tags and a title, header, button, bold text in a div and 2 anchor tags which redirect to links.

dashboard.html contains another 34 linkes of very basic and simple html code which is the head tag again with the 3 main meta tags and a title, nav tag with normal text and an anchor tag which redirects to the index.html page and some lists.

login.html again contains 37 linkes of very simple html code which again is the 3 main meta tags and the title, 5 labels and input tags and a button.
